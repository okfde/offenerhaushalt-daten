# Niedersachsen

## Data 
All data is taken from the original budget and was extracted with Tabula.
- (you can skip this step if the original pdf/tabula data did not change) run `convert_functions.py` and `convert_groups.py` to generate the `niedersachsen-funktionen` 
  and `niedersachsen-gruppen` json files (not that you need to manually edit the `niedersachsen-funktionen.json`) file 
  as described in the `convert_functions.py` file comment at the bottom
- run `main.py`
