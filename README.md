# offenerhaushalt-daten

This repo shall give an idea of how Budget data originally looks like and how it can be prepared to fit our standard for OffenerHaushalt.de. Each folder includes an original budget file or the origin of a website, some skripts to scrape and clean the data, and the enriched data file that we uploaded to OffenerHaushalt.de 

More information regarding our data standard can be found [here](https://offenerhaushalt.de/page/datenstandard.html) We use OpenSpending as a backend for our data.
